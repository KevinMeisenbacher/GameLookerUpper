A <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a> version released on April 25, 2014. Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin, a definitive version of the game will be released on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in April 2015.<\/p><p>It is the third game in the <a href=\"\/souls\/3025-2169\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2169\">Souls<\/a> franchise and the sequel to cult hit <a href=\"\/dark-souls\/3030-32697\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32697\">Dark Souls<\/a>. However, the game is not a direct sequel to the original game and instead takes place in a new land, 'Dragleic.' Dark Souls II is also the first Souls game to not be directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki. He instead acted as a supervisor and the game was directed by Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><p>Dark Souls II was announced during the 2012 SpikeTV VGAs on December 7, 2012 with a CGI trailer. FromSoftware confirmed that the game would be released for PS3, X360, and PC, via their <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/senden_ogu\/statuses\/277261817586262016\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">official Twitter page<\/a> and website.<\/p><p>The new directors stated that the game would be 'more straightforward and more understandable.' This lead many to believe that the game would be made easier or 'dumbed down' but Miyazaki, followed up these statements and reassured fans that the 'core' of the series would be protected.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Gameplay in Dark Souls II largely follows on from that of Dark Souls, with some minor and major changes. These include:<\/p><ul><li>As in Dark Souls, a player may be in human form or undead form; but, in Dark Souls II, each successive death while in undead form will incur a cumulative penalty to the player's maximum health, up to a maximum penalty of 50%. This deteriorating undead process can be reversed with certain items, and the health penalty can be mitigated with a certain ring.<\/li><li>While in undead form, the player's character will gradually decay in physical appearance, including skin going green, face becoming disfigured, and hair falling out. As they get closer to the 50% HP drop, the cosmetic effects become more pronounced.<\/li><li>Players may now be invaded in both human form and in undead form. Invasions are slightly more common in human form, though undead are no longer immune.<\/li><li>Summoned ally phantoms now have a limited time duration before they are automatically dismissed; a phantom's time limit will decrease faster the more enemies they kill.<\/li><li>Stats have been altered in many small and large ways, such as removing Resistance, adding Adaptability and Agility, transferring spell casting speed from Dexterity to Attunement, adding scaling for Bleed and Poison effects to Dexterity, seemingly adding elemental damage scaling to Intelligence and Faith, and other unconfirmed changes.<\/li><li>The speed of the player's rolling is no longer entirely dependent on their equipment weight, but depends instead on their Agility stat, which is described as affecting \"swiftness of movement,\" including parrying speed, shield readying speed, and possibly more. Players will also roll faster if their encumbrance is under 70%, and faster still when under 50%.<\/li><li>Player inventory has been made denser, with more information on screen at once and a grid view of items instead of a list view. Like in Dark Souls, the player can carry as many items as they wish without incurring an encumbrance penalty. Encumbrance only applies to items being worn, such as weapons, armor and rings.<\/li><li>The Bonfire system from Dark Souls has been expanded. The player can burn certain items for beneficial effects, and is able to teleport to any bonfire in the world from the offset (in Dark Souls, the player needed a special late-game item and were limited in the number of bonfires it applied to). The only requirement is that the player must find and light the bonfire first. After meeting a certain NPC, all the bonfire locations appear on the player's menu, though will be obfuscated if the player has not found the bonfire (they can, however, use the presence of an obfuscated bonfire as a hint that one can be found in that region).<\/li><li>Item durability is more pronounced, but all item durability is automatically refilled whenever the player rests at a bonfire. Certain strong items have a very limited durability, making them ideal for boss fights only. If an item breaks entirely, with the durability hitting 0, they need to be repaired at a blacksmith vendor.

Going up ranks unlocks new abilities and items, and are sometimes the only way to learn certain spells.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Bell Keepers<\/strong> - A PvP covenant with their own territory that allow them to invade other players' games without the use of items, but only if those players are passing through two special regions. Covenant members have a ring that lets them be summoned as a black phantom whenever the regions Belfry Luna or Belfry Sol (hidden areas accessed in Lost Bastille and Iron Keep, respectively) have players in them. The Bell Keepers can be joined by talking to the non-hostile NPC guarding both the above areas.<\/li><li><strong>Blue Sentinels <\/strong>- A PvP covenant that targets \"sinful\" players, ones that often invade others or kill non-hostile NPCs. Blue Sentinels can invade the worlds of sinners with special blue versions of the usual invasion item (Cracked Blue Orbs, instead of Cracked Red Orbs). They will also appear blue in other worlds. The Blue Sentinels can be joined by defeating the optional boss in Heide's Tower of Flame and speaking to the NPC behind the fog gate.<\/li><li><strong>Brotherhood of Blood <\/strong>- A PvP covenant that is analogous to the Darkwraiths, in that they reward straightforward invasions of other players' worlds, with the goal of killing the host player's character. The Brotherhood of Blood can be joined by defeating the optional boss in Undead Purgatory (from the Huntsman's Copse) and speaking to the NPC beyond the fog gate.<\/li><li><strong>Company of Champions <\/strong>- A covenant intended for expert players, which has the effect of increasing the difficulty of all enemies in the game as if the player is on New Game+ or has used a Bonfire Ascetic item. The means to join this covenant can be found in the hub town of Majula.<\/li><li><strong>Dragon Remnants <\/strong>- A PvP covenant that focuses on honorable duels, rather than invasions. The player summons a Dragon Remnants covenant member from their summon sign, which resembles a grey eye, and fights them. They earn points for the covenant by defeating this summoned dueler. In order to join the Dragon Remnants, the player must find a dragon-related item in a late-game area and return it to the rare goods vendor in Iron Keep.<\/li><li><strong>Heirs of the Sun <\/strong>- A co-operative covenant that makes a return from Dark Souls, the members of which are colloquially referred to as \"Sunbros\". Rather than earning rewards for defeating players in other worlds, they instead help them. If the summoned spirit, which is golden rather than white, is able to help the host defeat the next boss or otherwise spends ten minutes in the host's world assisting them, they are rewarded with an item that boosts covenant points. They are automatically kicked out with no reward if the host character should die. The Heirs of the Sun can be joined by finding a broken statue in Harvest Valley.<\/li><li><strong>Pilgrims of Dark <\/strong>- A single-player focused covenant that allows the player to take on very difficult bonus dungeons filled with tough NPC black phantoms, many of which are cameos of NPCs from Dark Souls. Defeating all three bonus dungeons leads to a special boss named Darklurker, which can only be fought by joining this covenant. Many of the covenant's rank rewards are Hex spells. The Pilgrims can be joined by finding the gates to the three bonus dungeons, spread across Dranglaic, and speaking to the NPC that guards them.<\/li><li><strong>Rat King <\/strong>- A PvP covenant that allows members to invade other worlds if those players come near their turf, as set by a summon sign. Invading players then help the enemies in the area defeat the interloping player.

Striving to make his kingdom the best it could be, he enlisted the help of the <a href=\"..\/..\/the-nexus\/95-2211\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nexus<\/a> - a great tower harboring the souls of the dead. King Allant used the Soul Arts to improve life in Boletaria, making it prosper beyond its previous limits.<\/p><p>With time, King Allant was still unsatisfied. He demanded more. He knew where the greatest power of all was to be held. He took it upon himself to delve beneath the Nexus and awake the great being below, \" <a href=\"..\/..\/the-old-one\/94-16895\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Old One<\/a>\". It was a being of indescribable hunger, a being which feeds on the souls of the dead, growing hungrier and craving more powerful souls with every soul it devours.<\/p><p>With the awakening of <a href=\"\/the-old-one\/3005-16895\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16895\">The Old One<\/a>, Boletaria began to be enveloped in a great fog. The fog spread outward, blanketing Boletaria in a haze of death. No man or woman who passed within the borders of the fog were ever seen again. Worse than that, the fog still grows, and if not stopped, will consume all in existence.<\/p><p>Warriors from all over were drawn to the fog. People seeking wealth, fame, power, and repentance all flocked to Boletaria. And yet the fog still grows.<\/p><p>The player takes on the role of a adventurer, crossing into the fog of Boletaria.<\/p><h2>Character Creation<\/h2><p>When starting a new character, the player chooses a gender and a place of origin (North, South, East, or West) and is able to <a href=\"\/customizable-characters\/3015-155\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-155\">fine-tune<\/a> the character's appearance using a system of sliders.<\/p><p>The player must also select a <a href=\"\/classes\/3015-405\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-405\">class<\/a> of sorts - however, classes in Demon's Souls are less concrete than in most other RPGs, serving more as examples of the various approaches the player might eventually decide on. The starting class only affects starting stats, gear, and - if applicable - magic spells. Any player can use any weapon, armor, ring, or magic regardless of initial class choice (though a few pieces of equipment are gender-specific.) The use of weapons, armor and magic is governed only by stat requirements, and rings have no restrictions.<\/p><p>Those who want to use magic or miracles must first attain at least 10 in both Intelligence and Magic before \"Wizard\" spells can be learned, and a 10 in Faith before miracles can be learned. Casting spells or miracles requires a Catalyst or a Talisman, respectively.<\/p><h3>Classes<\/h3><ul><li><b>Soldier:<\/b> (Soul Level 6) The default class, a balanced character geared for melee combat with no particular weaknesses or strengths. Starts with a set of plate armor, a broadsword, and a spear.<\/li><li><b>Knight<\/b>: (Soul Level 4) Physically strong and heavily armored, with the best starting shield, but lacking in Vitality compared to other melee classes. The bulky starting armor also greatly reduces mobility.<\/li><li><b>Hunter<\/b>: (Soul Level 6) A balanced character that is equipped with a bow, a one-handed <a href=\"\/battle-axe\/3055-2214\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2214\">battle axe<\/a>, a shield, and and leather armor.<\/li><li><b>Priest<\/b>: (Soul Level 6) A warrior of the light. Starts with a healing miracle, a mace, and chain armor.<\/li><li><b>Magician<\/b>: (Soul Level 6) A strong user of fire magic. Weak in physical offense and defense, and very little armor at the outset.<\/li><li><b>Wanderer<\/b>: (Soul Level 6) Melee fighter that specializes in lighter armor and Dexterity-based weapons.<\/li><li><b>Barbarian<\/b>: (Soul Level 9) Physically powerful with very high HP, but only comes equipped with two clubs and no armor. Has the highest starting soul level, tied with the Thief.<\/li><li><b>Thief<\/b>: (Soul Level 9) Lightly armed with a dagger and Dark Leather armor. Starts with very high Luck and Dexterity, along with a high Soul Level.<\/li><li><b>Temple Knight:<\/b> (Soul Level 4) A holy warrior who wields a halberd and casts healing miracles. Comes exceptionally well-armored with a suit of Mirdan Scale.<\/li><li><b>Royalty<\/b>: (Soul Level 1) Usually considered the easiest starting class. Lacking in stats, but has very rare starting gear such as an MP-regenerating ring, and can cast a fairly powerful, easy-to-use attack spell (Soul Arrow). The low Soul Level is also helpful to experienced players, as it allows more control over stat progression.<\/li><\/ul><h3><b>Starting Class Stats<\/b><\/h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Class<\/th><th><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/stat-vitality\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vit<\/a><\/th><th><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/stat-intelligence\" rel=\"nofollow\">Int<\/a><\/th><th><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/stat-endurance\" rel=\"nofollow\">End<\/a><\/th><th><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/stat-strength\" rel=\"nofollow\">Str<\/a><\/th><th><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/stat-dexterity\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dex<\/a><\/th><th><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/stat-magic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic<\/a><\/th><th><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/stat-faith\" rel=\"nofollow\">Faith<\/a><\/th><th><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/stat-luck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luck<\/a><\/th><th><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/stat-slvl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starting<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/stat-slvl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soul Level<\/a><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/soldier\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soldier<\/a><\/td><td>14<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/knight\" rel=\"nofollow\">Knight<\/a><\/td><td>10<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/hunter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hunter<\/a><\/td><td>12<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/priest\" rel=\"nofollow\">Priest<\/a><\/td><td>13<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/magician\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magician<\/a><\/td><td>9<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/wanderer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderer<\/a><\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/barbarian\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barbarian<\/a><\/td><td>15<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/thief\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thief<\/a><\/td><td>10<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/temple-knight\" rel=\"nofollow\">Temple Knight<\/a><\/td><td>11<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/royalty\" rel=\"nofollow\">Royalty<\/a><\/td><td>8<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19745\/876601-demon63.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-876601\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.560546875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19745\/876601-demon63.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-876601\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/19745\/876601-demon63.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19745\/876601-demon63.jpg 512w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/19745\/876601-demon63.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/a><\/figure><p>Demon's Souls plays a bit differently from most other <a href=\"..\/..\/hack-and-slash\/92-469\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">hack'n'slash<\/a> games. The combat system seems rather basic at first, but is very intuitive. It shows itself to be very intricate and robust, allowing for immense flexibility to adjust to the individual's play style.<\/p><ul><li>The player can do a light attack, heavy attack, <a href=\"..\/..\/block\/92-1843\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">block<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/parrying\/92-2485\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">parry<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/backstab\/92-3236\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">backstab<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/riposte\/92-4316\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">riposte<\/a>, and a dodging-roll - all behaving differently based on what equipment the player currently has on.<\/li><li>Crossbows can be shot at range, while bows allow faster shooting and the option of manual first-person aiming.<\/li><li>The player can cast a range of <a href=\"..\/..\/evocation\/92-5737\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">offensive<\/a> and defensive magic spells with catalysts, and ask for miracles from <a href=\"..\/..\/god\/94-7315\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">God<\/a> to <a href=\"..\/..\/health\/92-130\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">heal<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/protector\/92-2468\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">protect<\/a>, or attack with talismans.<\/li><li>To defeat demons, the player must learn to use the right weapon against the right enemy. Enemies each have unique weaknesses to certain attacks, spells, and usable items, while being strongly resistant to others. It is not wise to attack an armored enemy with a blade, nor is it efficient to use fire attacks on enemies made out of fire.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Game Areas<\/h2><ul><li><a href=\"..\/..\/the-nexus\/95-2211\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Nexus<\/a>: Hub world, from which to access the 5 other worlds. Contains helpful <a href=\"..\/..\/non-player-character\/92-967\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NPC<\/a>s that sell items, upgrade weapons and let the player level up. In here the player is also totally safe from Black Phantoms.<\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/boletarian-palace\/95-2207\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boletarian Palace<\/a> (World 1). Uniquely divided into four sections, as opposed to three. Once the Palace of King Allant, it is now overrun by ghoulish humanoids and fierce Red- and Blue Eyed Knights. It is also home to two fire-breathing dragons, raining death from above. Deep within the Palace is where <a href=\"\/yuria-the-witch\/3005-11180\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11180\">Yuria the Witch<\/a> is being imprisoned.<\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/stonefang-tunnel\/95-2208\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stonefang Tunnel<\/a> (World 2). A network of mines, guarded by bosses that favor flame attacks. Best bring fire protection! Also contains a nest of <a href=\"..\/..\/crystal-gecko\/92-3319\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crystal Geckos<\/a>. Home also to the immensely helpful <a href=\"..\/..\/blacksmith-ed\/94-11182\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blacksmith Ed<\/a>. Most enemies here use the same style of attack and have the same weaknesses, so equipment strategies are best worked out here.<\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/tower-of-latria\/95-2209\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tower of Latria<\/a> (World 3). A prison tower. A cruel, inhospitable place rising up above a swamp. Powerful magical sentries guard the halls, with the upper spires the domain of evil gargoyles. <a href=\"..\/..\/sage-freke\/94-11184\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sage Freke<\/a> is imprisoned here.<\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/shrine-of-storms\/95-2210\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shrine of Storms<\/a> (World 4). An ancient mausoleum and burial ground surrounded by jagged, wind-swept cliffs. Home to agile skeletons, cruel Reapers that summon wraiths, and the occasional flying manta ray. Within its bowels is <a href=\"..\/..\/saint-urbain\/94-11196\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saint Urbain<\/a>.<\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/valley-of-defilement\/95-2212\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Valley of Defilement<\/a> (World 5). Possibly the most dangerous place of all, where the very environment is hostile. An atmosphere of decrepitude, decay, disease, and constant rain. Enemies include corrupted humanoids, insects, rats, and worse. Poison and plague are a common hazard here. Not for the inexperienced. Fire is helpful through most of this world.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Soul Form and Body Form<\/h3><p>At the start of the game, the player is in Soul form. In Soul form, the player has 50% of his total HP (75% with a ring found early on in the first level, the Cling Ring) but deals more damage to enemies. By killing a Boss, the player regains their body. In addition to having full HP and dealing less damage, the player can then also summon other players as Blue Phantoms to help him. However, the player can also be invaded by malicious Black Phantoms, other players looking to murder the host. Staying in Soul Form is the best way to deter invaders. Additionally, when in Body Form, dying will cause a shift of World Tendency towards Black. Killing a Boss will result in a shift of World Tendency towards White.<\/p><h3>Souls<\/h3><p>Souls are the universal form of currency in the game. They are used for buying items, upgrading weapons and leveling up characters. Every enemy killed grants Souls, as does killing a Boss. The player can also find Soul items which can be used to gain a fixed amount of Souls. Upon death in either Form, any carried souls are dropped at the point of demise. The player must then carefully make their way back to them to recover them before dying again or else those Souls are gone forever. Boss Demons have unique Souls which can be used to upgrade weapons, learn unique Magic or Miracles, or all of the above.<\/p><p>Below is a table listing each world's bosses in their likely order of appearance, the souls which they drop when slain, and the possible uses of each soul. Note that every soul can be consumed for souls if not used for another purpose.<\/p><table><tbody><tr><th>World<\/th><th>Boss<\/th><th>Soul<\/th><th>Uses<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Tutorial<\/b><\/td><td><a href=\"..\/..\/vanguard\/94-11215\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vanguard<\/a>*<\/td><td><a href=\"..\/..\/grey-demons-soul\/93-2150\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grey Demon's Soul<\/a><\/td><td>Dozer Axe weapon;

A character has a limit to the weight of his currently equipped gear, which can be increased by raising the Endurance statistic. When over half of that limit, movement will be somewhat sluggish and rolling will be considerably slower. On the flipside, heavier armor provides more protection.<\/p><p>Stamina is what is used for all actions. Sprinting, attacking, rolling, defending, everything costs stamina. When out of stamina the only option is to simply run. Stamina regenerates fast, however the heavier the armor, the slower it regenerates. Stamina can also be increased by leveling the Endurance stat, though this benefit stops after Endurance 40. Equipment weight has a big impact on how the character plays. Bigger, heavier weapons are also slower to use and cost more stamina to swing, but do more damage.<\/p><h3>World Tendency<\/h3><p>Starting out, each world has a neutral tendency. By killing bosses or Black Phantoms, the player can shift the tendency towards White, and by dying in Body Form or killing helpful NPCs, they shift it towards Black. By reaching Pure Black or Pure White World Tendency, specific events are unlocked, such as doors opening or Unique weapons appearing. Some characters may turn up and either offer side quests, or become hostile, depending on Tendency. Also it affects the challenge of the game itself as well as drop rates. The whiter the tendency the players HP is penalized less in soul form and the player does more damage and drop rates increase on healing items, the blacker the tendency the enemies hit harder but release more souls on death and drop rates increase on rare items.<\/p><p>Note that World Tendency is affected by multiplayer, which is the server's median and changes depending on what others are doing. An example: If a majority of the players in the game are doing things in the world to change their tendency to black, this will affect the median appropriately, and likewise for white. The server median is based on sessions, so after quitting the game the server median tendency is lost. It should also be noted that playing online will reset the World Tendencies to one level below White, so if anyone seeking to do the Pure World Tendency events should play the game offline by not logging into PSN.<\/p><h3>Character Tendency<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1401753-tendency.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1401753\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1401753-tendency.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1401753\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/17388\/1401753-tendency.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1401753-tendency.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/17388\/1401753-tendency.jpg 960w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/17388\/1401753-tendency.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/17388\/1401753-tendency.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><\/figure><p>Similar to World Tendency, certain actions will shift the tendency of the player's own character. Killing invading Black Phantoms or using the Resurrection spell on Blue Phantoms will bring them closer towards white, while killing certain NPCs or assassinating other players as a Black Phantom will shift them towards Black. Some weapons deal bonus damage based on tendency, and the player can earn unique rings for either Pure Black or Pure White Tendency. Lastly there is also a special NPC that only becomes available when a character's tendency is pure Black and certain extra conditions are met.<\/p><h3>New Game+<\/h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Lifecycle<\/th><th>Game Difficulty<\/th><th>Compared to NG<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>NG<\/td><td>Game difficulty has no modifier.<\/td><td>+ 0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NG+<\/td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 40% compared to NG (Neutral <a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT<\/a> assumed)<\/td><td>+ 40%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NG++<\/td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 8% compared to NG+ (Neutral <a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT<\/a> assumed)<\/td><td>+ 51.2 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NG+++<\/td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 8% compared to NG++ (Neutral <a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT<\/a> assumed)<\/td><td>+ 63.3 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NG4+<\/td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 8% compared to NG+++ (Neutral <a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT<\/a> assumed)<\/td><td>+ 76.4 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NG5+<\/td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 8% compared to NG4+ (Neutral <a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT<\/a> assumed)<\/td><td>+ 90.5 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NG6+<\/td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 8% compared to NG5+ (Neutral <a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT<\/a> assumed)<\/td><td>+ 105.7 %<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NG7+<\/td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 8% compared to NG6+ (Neutral <a href=\"http:\/\/demonssouls.wikidot.com\/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT<\/a> assumed)<\/td><td>+ 122.2 %<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><p><strong>Note:<\/strong> From the 8th playthrough onwards, the difficulty will not increase.<\/p><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><p>The game has a somewhat unique implementation of both player-versus-player and cooperative <a href=\"..\/..\/multiplayer-party-system\/92-939\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiplayer<\/a>. When in Body Form, the player can summon other players as Blue Phantoms to help, and other players can even jump into the player's game as black phantoms and try to assassinate them. At one point in the game a certain boss may even be replaced by a black phantom. To play in co-op mode requires a Blue Eye Stone while the player are in Soul Form to create a blue soul sign which living players can see and interact with to summon the player. To invade the game of a player in Body form requires the use of a Black Eye Stone while the player is in Soul form. Lastly there is a special Red Eye Stone that works exactly like the Blue Eye Stone except when summoned the player is a Black Phantom, this stone is primarily used for organizing duels. The Red Eye Stone has two other unique traits, it is the only stone that can be used to create a soul sign when the player is in body form (the player character's HP if summoned will revert to soul forum levels), and anyone killed by someone summoned via the Red Eye Stone will lose a level; likewise the Black Phantom summoned this way also loses a level if they die regardless of how it happens.<\/p><h3>Online<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1401767-message.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1401767\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.61666666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1401767-message.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1401767\"><img alt=\"Trap ahead.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1401767-message.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1401767-message.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Trap ahead.\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1401767-message.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1401767-message.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Trap ahead.<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul><li>One host can summon up to 2 players to play <a href=\"..\/..\/cooperative-play\/92-108\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cooperatively<\/a> in most sections of the game.<\/li><li>There is a thorough messaging system that allows players to leave hints, advice, or even tricks meant to help or deceive others.

Eschewing the story elements of Diablo 3, Adventure Mode allows players to take on randomized missions in any Act setting of the game. Completing these bounties give bonus experience, loot and gold, as well as Rift Keystone Fragments, which allow players to enter large, randomized dungeons called Nephalem Rifts for even more loot and gold. Inside of Nephalem Rifts, players are more likely to earn legendary loot. A separate form of Rift entitled Great Rifts are unlocked using Greater Rift Keys, and provide a scaling challenge that becomes harder the more you invest in the key by ranking it up after successful clears. From these Greater Rifts, which must be completed under a set time limit, the player can loot Legendary Gems that have extremely powerful primary and secondary effects, often augmenting or empowering character builds in significant ways. Some new zones are only accessible inside of Rifts, including the Cesspools and, in a future patch, the Ruins of Sescheron - the Barbarian city featured in the <a href=\"\/diablo-ii-lord-of-destruction\/3030-15589\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15589\">Diablo II: Lord of Destruction<\/a> cinematic.<\/p><p> <\/p><h4>Leaderboards and Seasons<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130632\/2719122-leaderboards.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2719122\" data-ratio=\"0.6697965571205\" data-width=\"1278\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1278px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130632\/2719122-leaderboards.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2719122\"><img alt=\"The Solo Barbarian Greater Rift Leaderboard\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/130632\/2719122-leaderboards.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130632\/2719122-leaderboards.jpg 1278w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/13\/130632\/2719122-leaderboards.jpg 960w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/130632\/2719122-leaderboards.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Solo Barbarian Greater Rift Leaderboard\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/130632\/2719122-leaderboards.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130632\/2719122-leaderboards.jpg 1278w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/13\/130632\/2719122-leaderboards.jpg 960w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/130632\/2719122-leaderboards.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Solo Barbarian Greater Rift Leaderboard<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Subsequent patches to Reaper of Souls included the addition of <a href=\"\/leaderboard\/3015-30\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-30\">Leaderboards <\/a>which track players progress as they complete higher ranks of the Greater Rift system.
