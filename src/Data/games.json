The story mode allows you to go through the anime's storyline starting from the entrance into Hueco Mundo right until the epic conclusion between <a href=\"\/ichigo-kurosaki\/3005-1653\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1653\">Ichigo<\/a> (the series' main character) and <a href=\"\/sosuke-aizen\/3005-2208\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2208\">Aizen<\/a> (the series' main antagonist). There are over 10 missions, each with their own set of dialogue and mission objectives. Also included in the game is a mission based mode in which you are able to play as any of the characters in the game and go through various different objectives. Also included is a competition mode called \"Soul Attack.\" In this mode, you are able to compete with your friends locally to see who can score the most \"Soul Points\" (the in-game currency). This mode is played one person at a time.<\/p><p>Each character is voiced by their anime actor in both English and Japanese.<\/p><p>Every time you complete an activity in the game, you earn the in-game currency, \"Soul Points\" which are used to level up your character. Your character starts at level 1 and you must use the points to purchase orbs that will power up your character. Every orb you unlock increases your level. There is no limit to your level, it only stops once you unlock all the orbs. All the orbs are on a grid system. Each character has their own square (some characters such as Ichigo have a larger scale). Orbs for these squares usually consist of added health, spiritual pressure (another word for mana), defense, or additional powers ups. You may unlock support orbs, which give added boosts, such as added combo times or healing per strike. Once you complete your character's grid, you may pass to other grids. However, to unlock other grids, you must level up the respective character's level.<\/p><p>Here are some key components within the game's HUD:<\/p><ul><li>Health - Your character's health.<\/li><li>Spiritual Pressure - A sort of Mana. You use your special attacks with this.<\/li><li>Ignition - Hitting enough enemies will allow you ignition to fill up. Once full, you can enter a powered mode, and allows you to use your most powerful attack.<\/li><li>Combo - The higher the combo, the faster your Ignition bar rises and the more Soul Points you get at the end of the mission.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Playable Characters<\/h2><table><thead><tr><th>Name<\/th><th>Attack Type \/ Weapon<\/th><th>Ignition Power<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"\/ichigo-kurosaki\/3005-1653\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1653\">Ichigo Kurosaki<\/a><br \/>includes : Bankai<br \/>Final<br \/>Skullclad<\/td><td>Sword -

The story mode now continues until the \"Turn Back the Pendulum\" arc, and this is the first HtS game to include tournament and character customization modes.<\/p><p>Like the third Bleach movie (Fade to Black), Heat the Soul 6 contains a theme song by Porno Graffiti. It is called \"Koyoi, Tsuki ga Miezutomo\" (Tonight, Even if You Can't See the Moon).<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Bleach: Heat the Soul 6 keeps the basic style of all HtS games. It is a fighting game with 3D cel-shaded graphics. In it the player fights (in one of 29 stages from familiar locations in the anime\/movies) with the aim to 'KO' opponents - that is, empty their health gauge completely by using any attacks at the character's disposal.<\/p><p>Matches typically start with each character speaking a phrase (introducing themselves, taunting or something similar), and an announcer counting down (\"Can you survive? Ready.. Fight!\"). Once the match is over (when one person or team is defeated) the winner is announced; a 'Perfect Victory' can even be declared if the victor manages to win without taking any damage. How you win always stays the same, though battle conditions may differ (sometimes there might be a 'no blocking' rule, greater damage output for that battle or something similar).<\/p><h3>Controls<\/h3><p><u>Single Player<\/u><\/p><p>The D-pad or analog stick moves your character. Hold the opposite direction the character is facing to block, or tap up or down to flash step in the respective direction. The Triangle button makes the character jump, and usually air dash if you double tap it.The Square button will charge the reiatsu gauge (holding this button will charge it faster). This is the bar below the health meter, and must either be completely blue or completely green to be able to execute a special attack. Special attacks are one or more moves unique to a character, and are activated by pressing either Square + X or Square + Circle. Square + Triangle activates Soul Blaze. Soul Blaze lets the player attack the enemy with a quick, successive string of hits (depending on what buttons are pressed during it, and how quickly in succession they are pressed).<\/p><p>X is a basic weak attack, with Circle being heavy attack. Both can be used with directional buttons (eg. X + down makes the character execute a low weak attack, usually a kick).<\/p><p>The R trigger is combo cancel, while R trigger + L trigger powers the character up. This can be achieved once the reiatsu gauge is completely full (completely green). If the character has a Bankai, Resurreccion stage or a corresponding form they will transform into it (and often stay that way for the rest of the battle once the reiatsu gauge has depleted).<\/p><p><u>Tag Team<\/u><\/p><p>The controls change slightly if the player uses a team of two characters in a match. In 'tag team' play there is no combo cancelling, powering up or transforming (though the player can select from a character's various forms to play as before the battle starts). Any team-based actions require waiting for a short amount of time after they've been used before they can be activated again.<\/p><p>L trigger in this mode changes the character for the other character the player had selected. Also, while being hit this button will temporarily switch the 'active' character with the player's 'inactive' one, and this inactive one will take any hits instead during the time they are out.<\/p><p>Pressing R trigger will summon the other character temporarily. This other character will ideally assist the player by performing an attack.<\/p><p>L trigger + R trigger will activate Tag Team mode - for a short amount of time the player will not have to wait between performing any team-based actions.<\/p><p>Some unique special attacks can be used in Tag Team mode depending on the two characters used (these are normally characters that have some sort of friendship, relationship or rivalry such as Jyuushirou Ukitake and Shunsui Kyouraku, or Shinji Hirako and Hiyori Sarugaki). Characters will perform one of their usual special attacks one after the other if no unique attack between them exists.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><p>The entire cast of Heat the Soul 5 return, some with added costumes and forms:<\/p><p><strong>Turn Back the Pendulum<\/strong> - The Visored (Vizard), Sousuke Aizen and Kaname Tousen can now fight in their costumes from this arc. Kisuke Urahara (Captain) is playable and treated as a separate character, and has a slightly different moveset to his regular counterpart. Tessai Tsukabishi, as he is seen in \"Turn Back the Pendulum\" is playable for the first time as well.<\/p><p><strong><a data-ref-id=\"3015-1167\" href=\"\/vizard\/3015-1167\/\" slug=\"vizard\">Visored<\/a><\/strong> - Mashiro Kuna and Rose Otoribashi join the cast, making all Visored but two playable in this game.<\/p><p><strong><a data-ref-id=\"3015-2593\" href=\"\/espada\/3015-2593\/\" slug=\"espada\">Espada<\/a><\/strong> - Three Espada are now playable in their Resurreccion forms:<\/p><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-18525\" href=\"\/neliel-tu-oderschvank\/3005-18525\/\" slug=\"neliel-tu-oderschvank\">Nelliel Tu Odelschwanck<\/a> (Gamuza)<\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-9080\" href=\"\/nnoitra-jiruga\/3005-9080\/\" slug=\"nnoitra-jiruga\">Nnoitra Gilga<\/a> (Santa Teresa)<\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-9082\" href=\"\/szayzel-aporro-granz\/3005-9082\/\" slug=\"szayzel-aporro-granz\">Szayel Aporro Granz<\/a> (Fornicaras)<\/li><\/ul><p><a data-ref-id=\"3005-18875\" href=\"\/tia-harribel\/3005-18875\/\" slug=\"tia-harribel\">Tier Harribel<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9081\" href=\"\/zemmori-lerouz\/3005-9081\/\" slug=\"zemmori-lerouz\">Zommari Rureaux<\/a> (also with his Resurreccion 'Brujeria'), alongside Dark Rukia (from the Bleach: Fade to Black movie) and Ryuuken Ishida are the remaining new characters in this game.<\/p><p>This brings the total of playable characters up to 74.<\/p><p>In addition, various other characters from the Bleach franchise cameo in the game (such as in the opening or in Soul Championship mode), but they are not usable.<\/p><h2>Story Mode<\/h2><p>Covering everything from Ichigo's early time as a Substitute Shinigami up until the \"Turn Back the Pendulum\" arc, this mode consists of 61 stages. These stages are grouped into ten parts according to which anime story arc (or movie) they are set in.<\/p><p>After beating each battle the player will get a rank for it. This is based on performance, with the highest and best rank being an S. Receiving an A or S rank on each stage often gives a 'secret' stage as a reward. More playable characters are unlocked by beating relevant story stages too.<\/p><h2>Soul Championship<\/h2><p>This mode consists of 63 tournament-style scenarios, grouped into 'ranks' of difficulty. The player must complete all (or at least most) of the previous rank scenarios before the next, higher rank is unlocked. These ranks are arranged according to difficulty, with D as the lowest and SSS as the highest.<\/p><p>Some battles are entirely normal, but some have 'conditions' imposed upon them (there may be one where only special attacks damage the enemy, or a 10 or more combo will only hurt them, and so on). Completing these battles gives 'Soul Codes', used to customize characters.<\/p><h2>Soul Customize<\/h2><p>The first HtS game to feature such a mode, here is where the player can customize any unlocked character. These customizations, as well as any Soul Codes, can be implemented just after the player picks a character to battle with (this option is green, while attack, technical and speedy Soul Styles are red, yellow and blue respectively).<\/p><h2>Other Modes<\/h2><h3>Arcade Mode (Arcade Style)<\/h3><p>Select a character (or two), and play against various opponents in six successive stages. The time taken to beat a run-through is recorded at the end, and items used in Soul Customization can be unlocked here as well.<\/p><h3>VS CPU<\/h3><p>Select one or a team of two characters, and play against CPU here. There are three options to choose from:<\/p><p><strong>Freestyle<\/strong> - A simple 'pick your character\/s, pick your enemy then pick your stage' mode.<\/p><p><strong>Survival<\/strong> - As the name suggests, the character (or team) must fight one battle after another and defeat as many opponents as possible before they themselves are beaten.<\/p><p><strong>Glotoneria<\/strong> - Named after Aaronieo Arruruerie's Zanpakutou, the player picks one character and faces off against one other character only. This opponent remains the same, however each time they are KO'ed they will get stronger. The player's character will not gain any health, so the battle lasts as long as the player does (or until 100 KOs are achieved). The time taken and KO amount will be recorded, and depending on how many KOs the player gets more Soul Codes are rewarded.<\/p><h3><strong>SOUL VS (Multiplayer)<\/strong><\/h3><p>This is where the player can fight against friends via Ad-Hoc (in the first option, Free Battle). There is also a second option called \u201cPirates Battle\u201d, which is a multiplayer battle to win Soul Codes.<\/p><h3>Training<\/h3><p>This mode houses both a training option and a tutorial. In Training, a character (or a team of two) can be selected to play as, as well as an enemy (or again, a team of two of them) and desired stage. Before the battle the player can also adjust how the CPU will behave (a level 1 \u2013 5 difficulty scale, or options such as the CPU won't do anything, the CPU won't block but will recover or the CPU will only block). Below this it is possible to turn on\/off Infinite Reiatsu gauge, turn on\/off Infinite Partner Assist and finally show\/hide the Command Panel (which if on will show every button the player presses, in order).<\/p><p>Under Tutorial, there are six of them that can be chosen from. Each has between two and four parts to them, and covers various aspects of the game.<\/p><h3>Appendix<\/h3><p><strong>Sound<\/strong> \u2013 Listen to sound effects, background music and character voice clips found in HtS 6. A character's voice gallery is available as soon as the player has unlocked and used them.<\/p><p><strong>Character Illustrated Picture Book<\/strong> <em>\u2013<\/em> A gallery of every playable character. Arcade mode must be completed as each character to unlock that person's image here.<\/p><p><strong>Convert<\/strong> \u2013 This is an option to load a save file from an older Heat the Soul game.

Platinum's Battle Frontier has been rebuilt brick-for-brick west of Olivine, ready to welcome any trainers who can best Johto's Elite Four. Also as in Platinum, each <a href=\"\/gym-leader\/3015-3385\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3385\">gym leader<\/a> may be challenged to a rematch after certain conditions are met, with each leader bringing a significantly stronger team for round two.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/kanto\/3035-206\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-206\">Kanto<\/a> has also undergone changes of its own. The Viridian Forest--chopped down in the original Gold and Silver--returns as a fully-featured area ready to meet all <a href=\"\/caterpie\/3015-1022\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1022\">Caterpie<\/a> and <a href=\"\/weedle\/3015-1040\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1040\">Weedle<\/a> needs. Cerulean Cave has likewise not collapsed in the remakes and powerful Pok\u00e9mon (along with one old familiar face) are ready to face any trainer strong enough to collect all 16 gym badges. Kanto trainers have <a href=\"\/hoenn\/3035-350\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-350\">Hoenn<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sinnoh\/3035-465\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-465\">Sinnoh<\/a> Pok\u00e9mon at their disposal, and certain radio stations now play the music needed to find those Pok\u00e9mon in the Kanto\/Johto region as well.<\/p><h3>Partner Pok\u00e9mon<\/h3><p>Taking a cue from Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, the Pok\u00e9mon in the first party slot now follows the player around outside of battle. The Pok\u00e9mon can be talked to in order to determine its condition, happiness, and even to take items it has found lying on the ground. This feature is also used by non-player characters seeking certain Pok\u00e9mon, who will refuse to acknowledge that the player has brought them the Pok\u00e9mon of their desire until it is out of its <a href=\"\/\">Pok\u00e9ball<\/a> and trotting along behind them.<\/p><h3>Pok\u00e9athlon<\/h3><p>Johto's Pok\u00e9mon contests are a major departure from the dog show-style contests in Hoenn and Sinnoh. In the Pok\u00e9athlon, each trainer brings a team of three Pok\u00e9mon to compete in a competitions of physical prowess. There are five sets of Pok\u00e9athlon competitions, each with a set of three minigames that emphasize a particular stat: the strength Pok\u00e9athlon, for instance, involves plenty of brick-smashing and sumo-style throwdowns, while the speed Pok\u00e9athlon involves Pok\u00e9mon leaping hurdles and competing to see which team can complete the most laps around a track within a time limit. Trainers receive points for their team's performance in each game, and the trainer with the highest total at the end (including any <a href=\"\/mario-party\/3030-6424\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6424\">Mario Party<\/a>-style bonus points) is the winner.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/60879\/1308674-hgss5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1308674\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.74561403508772\" data-width=\"228\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 228px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/60879\/1308674-hgss5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1308674\"><img alt=\"Timing the jumps of three Pok\u00e9mon at once is the major challenge in Hurdle Dash.\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/60879\/1308674-hgss5.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/60879\/1308674-hgss5.jpg 228w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px\" data-width=\"228\"><\/a><figcaption>Timing the jumps of three Pok\u00e9mon at once is the major challenge in Hurdle Dash.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Each Pok\u00e9mon is rated for the five Pok\u00e9athlon stats, with modifications made for the Pok\u00e9mon's personality and any Aprijuice it has consumed to (legally) increase its performance. The player controls his or her three-Pok\u00e9mon team through the use of the touch screen, directing their movements and actions through tapping, flicks, and drawing motions of the stylus. In contrast to Beauty Contests (which offered mostly superficial rewards), points earned in the Pok\u00e9athlon can be put towards items such as evolutionary stones, <a href=\"\/rare-candy\/3055-1273\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1273\">Rare Candies<\/a>, and apricorns.<\/p><h3>Improved Touchscreen Interface<\/h3><p>Many of the menus in HeartGold and SoulSilver have been redesigned for improved touchscreen control. The basic menu options can be called at any time by hitting their icon on the touchscreen, and the player's set items (such as the Bicycle or Dowsing MCHN) can be used in a similar manner. The items screen has received a major redesign as well, trading the awkward Pok\u00e9ball knob for a much cleaner and more intuitive interface. The PC box system is the most notable beneficiary of this upgrade, with the player now able to move Pok\u00e9mon between boxes and his or her team through drag-and-drop stylus controls.<\/p><h2>Pok\u00e9Walker<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1335551-pokewalker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1335551\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"293\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 293px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1335551-pokewalker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1335551\"><img alt=\"The Pokewalker with Pikachu inside.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px\" data-width=\"293\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1335551-pokewalker.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1335551-pokewalker.jpg 293w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Pokewalker with Pikachu inside.\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1335551-pokewalker.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1335551-pokewalker.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px\" data-width=\"293\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Pokewalker with Pikachu inside.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Pok\u00e9walker is the evolution of the old Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu toy released in November 1998.

The number of watts will not reset.<\/p><h2>Minigames on the Pokewalker<\/h2><h3>Dowsing Machine<\/h3><p>The dowsing machine is a <a href=\"\/minigames\/3015-116\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\"> minigame<\/a> on the Pok\u00e9walker. It is a glorified version of the shell game. It costs three watts (approximately 60 steps) to use.<\/p><p>There are six tufts of <a href=\"\/grass\/3055-198\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-198\"> grass<\/a> in a row, and the player has two chances to guess where the item is. If they guess correctly they get the item. If they guess incorrectly, they have another guess.

TMs are usually rare and will only unlock with a large number of steps.<\/p><h3>Pok\u00e9 Radar<\/h3><p>The Pok\u00e9 Radar is a minigame that is divided into two parts.<\/p><h4>Part One<\/h4><p>Where the player has to \u201cchase the Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d There are four tufts of grass, and an exclamation point will appear on one, they have to move to that patch of grass and press the action button before the Pok\u00e9mon runs away. The \u201crarer\u201d the Pok\u00e9mon, the longer the chase will go, up to a maximum of four times. Once the chase ends, the player will advance to part two.<\/p><h4>Part  Two<\/h4><p>An extremely simplified version of a Pok\u00e9mon battle. There are no <a href=\"\/attributes\/3015-1681\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1681\"> stats<\/a> taken into account, the player's Pok\u00e9mon and the enemy Pok\u00e9mon will have 4HP each. The player has three options: attack, evade, and catch.<\/p><ul><li><b>Attack<\/b> - The active Pok\u00e9mon will attack, obviously. Each attack does one point of damage, unless it is a <a href=\"\/critical-hit\/3015-97\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-97\"> critical hit<\/a>, then it does two points. The attack will not hit if the enemy evades it.<\/li><li><b>Evade<\/b> - The active Pok\u00e9mon attempts to <a href=\"\/dodge\/3015-2476\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2476\"> dodge<\/a> an incoming attack. If the opponent attacks while the player evades, they will dodge the attack, taking zero damage, and then counterattacks, dealing one damage back. If both Pok\u00e9mon evade, a \u201cstare down\u201d will occur, and nothing will happen.<\/li><li><b>Catch <\/b>- The player attempts to <a href=\"\/enemy-capture\/3015-981\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-981\">capture<\/a> the Pok\u00e9mon, like in the <a href=\"\/nintendo-ds\/3045-52\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">DS<\/a> game, the weaker the Pok\u00e9mon, the easier it will be to catch. 1 HP Pok\u00e9mon are pretty much guaranteed, while 4 HP Pok\u00e9mon are near impossible, although it has happened before.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Version Differences<\/h2><h3>Legendary Pokemon<\/h3><p>It wouldn't be a Pok\u00e9mon game without legendary Pok\u00e9mon to capture, and HeartGold and SoulSilver do not disappoint. The Johto legendaries make their proud appearance, while many of the Kanto and Hoenn legendaries come along for the ride:<\/p><h4>Lugia and Ho-Oh<\/h4><p>As in the first game, <a href=\"\/lugia\/3015-1815\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1815\">Lugia<\/a> and <a href=\"\/ho-oh\/3015-1816\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1816\">Ho-Oh<\/a> are available for capture in both versions of the game. The first is encountered at level 40 and must be either captured or defeated in order to continue in the game, while the second becomes available at level 70 after the player makes significant progress through Kanto.<\/p><p> <\/p><h4>The Legendary Beasts<\/h4><p>Gold and Silver's legendary trio (<a href=\"\/suicune\/3015-4103\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4103\">Suicune<\/a>, <a href=\"\/raikou\/3015-4102\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4102\">Raikou<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/entei\/3015-4104\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4104\">Entei<\/a>) are first encountered in Ecruteak's Burned Tower, which they soon leave in order to roam the wider world. Raikou and Entei can both be found randomly across Johto, while the player must spot Suicune in several different locations before finally getting the chance to capture it in Kanto.<\/p><p> <\/p><h4>The Legendary Birds<\/h4><p>New to the remakes is the reappearance of the legendary Pok\u00e9mon <a href=\"\/articuno\/3015-2011\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2011\">Articuno<\/a>, <a href=\"\/zapdos\/3015-2140\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2140\">Zapdos<\/a> and <a href=\"\/moltres\/3015-2141\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2141\">Moltres<\/a> (which could only be acquired in the original Gold and Silver by trading with Red, Blue, or Yellow). Articuno and Zapdos can be found in their original R\/B\/Y haunts (Seafoam Islands and the Power Plant, respectively), while Moltres has decided to make its nest at Mount Silver.<\/p><p> <\/p><h4>Latios and Latias<\/h4><p>The player encounters the Hoenn champion <a href=\"\/steven\/3005-10235\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10235\">Steven<\/a> while exploring Vermilion city, who informs them that <a href=\"\/latios\/3015-1774\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1774\">Latios<\/a> (SoulSilver) or <a href=\"\/latias\/3015-1775\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1775\">Latias<\/a> (HeartGold) has been found roaming the routes of <a href=\"\/kanto\/3035-206\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-206\">Kanto<\/a>. The other Lati is not available normally but can be captured through a special promotional event.<\/p><p> <\/p><h4>Mewtwo<\/h4><p>In the original Gold and Silver, the Cerulean Cave had collapsed and could not be explored. In the remakes the Cerulean Cave is not only open, but <a href=\"\/mewtwo\/3005-6335\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6335\">Mewtwo<\/a> still dwells within.<\/p><h4> <\/h4><h4>Kyogre, Groudon, and Rayquaza<\/h4><p>Similar to Latios and Latias, <a href=\"\/kyogre\/3015-1773\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1773\">Kyogre<\/a> (HeartGold) and <a href=\"\/groudon\/3015-1633\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1633\">Groudon<\/a> (SoulSilver) can be found hiding out in Johto and available for capture after a certain item is acquired. After acquiring the other through trading, Professor Oak will give the player an item necessary to summon (and hence, capture) <a href=\"\/rayquaza\/3015-1596\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1596\">Rayquaza<\/a>. Bring the civil war that nearly tore apart Hoenn in an ecological apocalypse to a new home in Johto!<\/p><h4> <\/h4><h4>Diagla, Palkia, and Giratina<\/h4><p>Though only available by transferring a special event Arceus to Heart Gold and Soul Silver, the three legendary dragons from Diamond and Pearl can be acquired in the remakes. Taking <a href=\"\/arceus\/3015-4087\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4087\">Arceus<\/a> to the Sinjoh Ruins allows the player to choose one of the aforementioned legendaries, each starting at level 1 and carrying its respective orb. Since the <a href=\"\/giratina\/3015-1395\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1395\">Giratina<\/a> acquired through this event carries the Griseous Orb (an item first introduced in Platinum, Which cannot be traded between games), this is the only legal way in Generation IV to obtain Giratina in its Origin Forme outside of <a href=\"\/pokemon-platinum\/3030-21676\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21676\">Pok\u00e9mon Platinum.<\/a><\/p><h3>Version Exclusive Pokemon<\/h3><h4>HeartGold<\/h4><ul><li>Mankey-&gt;Primeape<\/li><li>Growlithe-&gt;Arcanine<\/li><li>Omanyte-&gt;Omastar<\/li><li>Spinarak-&gt;Ariados<\/li><li>Gligar-&gt;Gliscor<\/li><li>Mantyke-&gt;Mantine<\/li><li>Phanpy-&gt;Donphan<\/li><li>Baltoy-&gt;Claydol<\/li><li>Sableye<\/li><li>Anorith-&gt;Armaldo<\/li><li>Kyogre<\/li><\/ul><h4>SoulSilver<\/h4><ul><li>Vuplix-&gt;Ninetales<\/li><li>Meowth-&gt;Persian<\/li><li>Kabuto-&gt;Kabutops<\/li><li>Ledyba-&gt;Ledian<\/li><li>Delibird<\/li><li>Skarmory<\/li><li>Teddiursa-&gt;Ursaring<\/li><li>Mawile<\/li><li>Gulpin-&gt;Swalot<\/li><li>Lileep-&gt;Cradily<\/li><li>Groudon<\/li><\/ul><p> <\/p><h2>Spikey-Eared Pichu<\/h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2709458\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/127698\/2709458-5907971186-Notch.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.3826219512195\" data-width=\"656\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 656px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/127698\/2709458-5907971186-Notch.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2709458\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px\" data-width=\"462\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/127698\/2709458-5907971186-Notch.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/127698\/2709458-5907971186-Notch.png 656w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/127698\/2709458-5907971186-Notch.jpg 462w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/127698\/2709458-5907971186-Notch.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/127698\/2709458-5907971186-Notch.png 656w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/127698\/2709458-5907971186-Notch.jpg 462w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px\" data-width=\"462\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Through Distribution at special events, a Pikachu colored Pichu from the event (Pokemon Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum) can be transferred to Pokemon HeartGold or Pokemon SoulSilver Versions for a chance to catch a special Pichu.

peace by spawning cohorts of monsters ravaging the land. To make things worse Camille - the princess of Klantol - is kidnapped. Luckily the thing happens during a tournament announced\u00a0 by her father - King Marcel - so finding a hero able to rescue her from the forces of evil is quite easy. You are that hero. <br \/><\/p><blockquote><p>The Dark Dragon was defeated, and Light returned to the land. The four heroes hailed for banishing the Darkness. The People were thankful that peace had returned, and the legend of the Hero of Light was passed down. Buta as time passed and people's lives improved, the legend was forgotten. So, too, dod their gratitude fade, and people began to take Light for granted. In a peace filled town, an old man stood preaching a seditious prophecy...\u00a0 \u00a0<br \/><br \/>\"Brothers and sisters, look! The crystal is cloudy! According to legend, Darkness was defeated! But, Light will grow out of control, eventually giving rise to Darkness once again. The clouding of the crystal foretells this future. The balance of the world will soon collapse!\"<br \/><br \/>The old prophet continued to speak to the passerby, and his voice rang through the town square. But, those who forgotten about the legend took no heed of the prophet's words. Sadly, at that very moment, the end of peace and prosperity was near. As the prophet had warned, the balance between Darkness and Light has been lost. Light had become too strong, and Darkness stirred again. An alchemist, a servant of Darkness, appeared...His name was Gillespie. Gillespie lured the old prophet to the outskirts of town, shattered the crystal that told of the Darkness and robbed the world of one virtuous man. <br \/><br \/>As a member of Dark order known as the Chaos Knights, Gillespie had another mission to complete...And so, he traveled to Klantol Castle...He cunningly befriended the knight Deatharte, whom King Marcel trusted above others, and he gave to Deatharte the \"Forbidden Fruit.\" With that accomplished, Gillespie left those lands. Deatharte was suspicious of Gillespie, and so he did not eat the fruit, until one day...when his curiosity got the better of him...and he tasted the \"Forbidden Fruit\"..<\/p><\/blockquote><h2>Overview<br \/><\/h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1518585-shining_soul_ii_world_map.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1518585\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 957px\" data-ratio=\"0.66457680250784\" data-width=\"957\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1518585-shining_soul_ii_world_map.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1518585\"><img alt=\"\u00a0World map.\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106662\/1518585-shining_soul_ii_world_map.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1518585-shining_soul_ii_world_map.jpg 957w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/106662\/1518585-shining_soul_ii_world_map.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106662\/1518585-shining_soul_ii_world_map.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>\u00a0World map.<\/figcaption><\/figure><br \/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1518583-shining_soul_ii_character_sheet.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1518583\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 957px\" data-ratio=\"0.66457680250784\" data-width=\"957\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1518583-shining_soul_ii_character_sheet.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1518583\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Archer character sheet.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106662\/1518583-shining_soul_ii_character_sheet.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1518583-shining_soul_ii_character_sheet.jpg 957w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/106662\/1518583-shining_soul_ii_character_sheet.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106662\/1518583-shining_soul_ii_character_sheet.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\u00a0Archer character sheet.\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106662\/1518583-shining_soul_ii_character_sheet.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1518583-shining_soul_ii_character_sheet.jpg 957w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/106662\/1518583-shining_soul_ii_character_sheet.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106662\/1518583-shining_soul_ii_character_sheet.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>\u00a0Archer character sheet.<\/figcaption><\/figure><i>Shining Soul II<\/i>\u00a0 is an RPG <a data-ref-id=\"3015-469\" href=\"\/hack-and-slash\/3015-469\/\">                 hack and slash<\/a> game with a fantasy setting. The game features a wide variety of interesting features such as: 8 different character classes, challenge arena, collectible monster cards, crafting system, charged attack system, 2 difficulty levels, different endings, multiple side quests and a lengthy story that can be played over and over again due to dozens of unique class-specific items to find (each character can equip up to 3 weapons). Just like in almost any other game of the genre when the character levels up it is up to the palyer how to distribute strength, dexterity, intelligence, stamina and skill points. A wise character build is crucial when players want to swiftly move through the quite lengthy campaign that gets gradually touher or try to beat the game at advanced difficulty mode in which monsters get noticeably stronger. The soul items, which can be equipped by every character, may serve as a great aid in defeating stronger enemies.
